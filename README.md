# Spin-Transport-Coil
Spin transport coil are designed to transport neutrons adiabatically inside the neutron guide. 
# Spin-Transport-Coil

Spin transport coils are designed to guide neutron spin adiabatically along the neutron guide in nEDM experiments.

## 📌 Motivation
Precise spin transport is essential to maintain neutron polarization in sensitive regions such as the precession chamber.

## ⚙️ Features
- Adiabatic transport coil design
- Field simulation and validation
- Modular code for field mapping, visualization, and optimization

## 🧠 Physics Background
- Based on adiabatic spin transport principles
- Uses Biot–Savart law / numerical simulations
- Aligns with Maxwell's equations: ∇·B = 0, ∇×B = μ₀J
