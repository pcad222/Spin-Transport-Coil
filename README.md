# Spin Transport Coil

Spin transport coils are designed to guide neutron spin **adiabatically** through a magnetic field inside a neutron guide. This is essential for preserving spin polarization in nEDM experiments.

## Motivation
Accurate spin transport ensures that neutrons retain their polarization during transport, critical for experiments involving magnetic resonance or EDM measurements.

##  Features
- Coil field modeling and visualization
- Adiabatic transport design principles
- Biot‚ÄìSavart simulation and gradient computation
- Physics-informed optimization (PINNs optional)

##  Physics Background
The transport relies on magnetic field configurations that change slowly in space:
